CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW AND RELATED WORK

2.1 EVOLUTION OF ANOMALY DETECTION TECHNIQUES

Anomaly detection has undergone significant evolution since early statistical quality control foundations. The field's progression reflects advancing computational capabilities, data availability, and theoretical understanding through distinct phases.

Early Foundations (1950s-1980s):
Theoretical groundwork established through classical statistical methods and quality control techniques. Frank Hampel's 1974 work on robust statistics provided mathematical foundations for identifying outliers, while Douglas Hawkins' 1980 definition of anomalies as "observations which deviate so much from other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism" became canonical reference.

Statistical Process Control (SPC) methods pioneered by Walter Shewhart and refined by W. Edwards Deming introduced control charts and process capability analysis for manufacturing quality assurance. These established fundamental concepts of normal variation bounds, statistical significance testing, and false alarm rates continuing to influence modern approaches.

Machine Learning Era (1990s-2000s):
Advent of machine learning brought data-driven approaches moving beyond parametric statistical assumptions toward flexible, data-adaptive methods. Clustering-based approaches like DBSCAN and k-means enabled unsupervised outlier identification based on density and distance metrics.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) gained prominence for anomaly detection through one-class classification approaches learning boundaries around normal data points in feature space. Kernel methods allowed capturing non-linear relationships while maintaining computational tractability.

Ensemble methods emerged as effective approaches improving detection robustness through combining multiple weak detectors. Random Forest and boosting algorithms demonstrated effectiveness for high-dimensional anomaly detection tasks.

Deep Learning Revolution (2010s-Present):
Introduction of deep neural networks marked paradigm shift in anomaly detection capabilities enabling automatic feature learning and capturing complex non-linear relationships in high-dimensional data. Autoencoder architectures proved particularly effective for unsupervised anomaly detection by learning compressed representations and identifying deviations through reconstruction error analysis.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and variants LSTM and GRU addressed critical challenge of temporal dependency modeling in sequential data enabling sophisticated time-series anomaly detection capabilities. Attention mechanisms and transformer architectures show promise for capturing long-range dependencies and contextual relationships.

2.2 STATISTICAL APPROACHES

Parametric Statistical Methods:
Traditional parametric approaches assume specific probability distributions for normal data identifying anomalies as observations with low likelihood under these distributions. Gaussian-based methods model data using multivariate normal distributions calculating Mahalanobis distances measuring deviation from mean.

Probability density function for multivariate Gaussian distribution:
f(x) = (1/(2π)^(d/2)|Σ|^(1/2)) * exp(-1/2(x-μ)^T Σ^(-1)(x-μ))

Where μ represents mean vector, Σ covariance matrix, d dimensionality. Anomalies identified as points where f(x) falls below predetermined threshold using statistical significance levels.

Non-parametric Statistical Methods:
Rank-based and percentile methods avoid distributional assumptions using order statistics and empirical distributions. Interquartile range (IQR) method identifies outliers as points falling below Q1 - 1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR where Q1 and Q3 represent first and third quartiles.

Modified Z-score approaches use median absolute deviation (MAD) instead of standard deviation providing robustness against extreme values:
MAD = median(|Xi - median(X)|)
Modified Z-score = 0.6745 × (Xi - median(X)) / MAD

Statistical Process Control Extensions:
Multivariate SPC methods extend traditional univariate control charts handling correlated variables and complex process relationships. Hotelling's T² control chart monitors multivariate process means using:
T² = n(x̄ - μ₀)^T S^(-1)(x̄ - μ₀)

Where x̄ sample mean vector, μ₀ target mean vector, S sample covariance matrix, n sample size. Chart signals anomalies when T² exceeds upper control limits based on F-distribution quantiles.

2.3 MACHINE LEARNING METHODS

Supervised Learning Approaches:
Require labeled training data containing both normal and anomalous examples. Classification algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks achieve high accuracy when quality labels available but face challenges due to class imbalance and difficulty obtaining representative anomaly examples.

One-class classification methods address labeling challenge learning only from normal data examples. One-Class SVM maps data to high-dimensional feature space using kernel functions finding smallest hypersphere containing most normal points:
min(R² + CΣξi) subject to ||φ(xi) - a||² ≤ R² + ξi, ξi ≥ 0

Where R sphere radius, a center, φ kernel mapping, ξi slack variables controlling outlier tolerance.

Unsupervised Learning Approaches:
Clustering-based methods identify anomalies as points distant from cluster centroids or belonging to small, sparse clusters. DBSCAN clustering excels finding outliers by identifying points in low-density regions, k-means based approaches flag points with large distances to assigned cluster centers.

Isolation Forest particularly effective unsupervised approach isolating anomalies by randomly selecting features and split values recursively partitioning data. Anomalies require fewer splits to isolate resulting in shorter path lengths in isolation trees:
E(h(x)) = c(n) - 2 × (n-1)/n for uniform distribution

Where h(x) path length for point x, n number of samples, c(n) average path length of unsuccessful searches in Binary Search Trees.

Semi-supervised Learning:
Leverage small amounts of labeled normal data combined with large unlabeled datasets improving detection performance. Label propagation methods spread normal class labels through similarity graphs, generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn normal data distributions from limited labeled examples.

2.4 DEEP LEARNING INNOVATIONS

Autoencoder-Based Detection:
Autoencoders consist of encoder and decoder networks learning compressed representations of input data and reconstructing original inputs. Normal data points achieve low reconstruction errors, anomalies produce higher errors due to departure from learned patterns.

Variants include variational autoencoders (VAEs) imposing probabilistic constraints on latent representations, denoising autoencoders learning robust representations by reconstructing clean inputs from corrupted versions. Convolutional autoencoders excel spatial anomaly detection in image and signal data through learned local feature detectors.

Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequences:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks address vanishing gradient problems in traditional RNNs through specialized memory cells with input, forget, and output gates controlling information flow:
forget gate: ft = σ(Wf · [ht-1, xt] + bf)
input gate: it = σ(Wi · [ht-1, xt] + bi) 
output gate: ot = σ(Wo · [ht-1, xt] + bo)
cell state: Ct = ft ⊙ Ct-1 + it ⊙ tanh(Wc · [ht-1, xt] + bc)
hidden state: ht = ot ⊙ tanh(Ct)

Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) simplify LSTM architecture combining forget and input gates into update gate zt, merging cell state with hidden state:
zt = σ(Wz · [ht-1, xt])
rt = σ(Wr · [ht-1, xt])
ĥt = tanh(Wh · [rt ⊙ ht-1, xt])
ht = (1-zt) ⊙ ht-1 + zt ⊙ ĥt

Transformer and Attention Mechanisms:
Self-attention mechanisms compute representation weights based on pairwise relationships between sequence elements enabling capture of long-range dependencies without sequential processing limitations. Multi-head attention allows model focusing on different representation subspaces simultaneously:
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKT/√dk)V

Where Q, K, V represent query, key, and value matrices derived from input representations, dk dimensionality of key vectors.

2.5 TIME SERIES ANOMALY DETECTION

Temporal Pattern Recognition:
Time series anomaly detection requires specialized approaches accounting for temporal dependencies, seasonality, and trend components. Decomposition methods separate time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components anomalies identified in residual portion after removing predictable patterns.

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models capture linear temporal dependencies through autoregressive and moving average components identifying anomalies as observations deviating significantly from model predictions. Seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) extends approach handling multiple seasonal patterns.

Deep Learning for Temporal Sequences:
LSTM and GRU networks excel capturing complex temporal dependencies in sequential data through gated memory mechanisms. Sequence-to-sequence architectures model normal temporal patterns identifying deviations through reconstruction error analysis or prediction residuals.

Convolutional approaches like TimeNet apply 1D convolutions along temporal dimensions capturing local temporal patterns, dilated convolutions enable exponential receptive field growth without increasing computational complexity.

Latency Requirements:
Real-time anomaly detection systems balance detection accuracy with processing speed requirements. Financial trading applications may require microsecond-level response times, industrial monitoring systems tolerate millisecond to second-level delays. NYC taxi fare application targets sub-second processing enabling timely operational responses.

Streaming Data Characteristics:
Continuous data streams present unique challenges including concept drift where normal behavior patterns gradually shift over time. Adaptive algorithms must continuously update models and thresholds without requiring complete retraining. Data quality issues such as missing values, outliers, and format changes require robust preprocessing and error handling mechanisms.

Resource Constraints:
Edge computing deployments face severe limitations in computational power, memory, and energy consumption. Model compression techniques like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation become essential deploying sophisticated deep learning models in resource-constrained environments.

Scalability Considerations:
Horizontal scaling through distributed processing architectures becomes necessary handling massive data volumes from multiple sources. Stream processing frameworks like Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, and Apache Flink enable distributed real-time analytics maintaining fault tolerance and consistency guarantees.

Current Limitations:
Despite significant advances, existing anomaly detection systems exhibit critical limitations. Many approaches struggle trade-off between detection sensitivity and false positive rates particularly in high-dimensional streaming data environments. Temporal dependency modeling remains challenging for traditional methods, deep learning approaches often lack interpretability requiring substantial computational resources.

Research Opportunities:
Several promising research directions emerge from current limitations. Hybrid approaches combining multiple detection techniques could leverage complementary strengths mitigating individual weaknesses. Explainable AI methods could improve model interpretability and operator trust in automated decisions. Federated learning approaches might enable collaborative model improvement preserving data privacy across organizations.
