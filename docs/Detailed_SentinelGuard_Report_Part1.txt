ABSTRACT

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, sensor networks, and digital transaction systems has created an unprecedented deluge of streaming data that requires real-time analysis for anomaly detection. Traditional statistical methods and rule-based systems have proven inadequate for handling the complexity, volume, and velocity of modern data streams, often generating excessive false positives while failing to detect subtle anomalous patterns indicative of fraud, system failures, or security breaches.

This research presents SentinelGuard, a cutting-edge anomaly detection system that leverages advanced deep learning autoencoder architectures to identify abnormal patterns in real-time streaming data with exceptional accuracy and minimal false positive rates. The system implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) autoencoders with sophisticated dynamic thresholding mechanisms, sequence-to-point anomaly propagation, and temporal smoothing techniques to ensure robust detection performance in production environments.

The methodology encompasses comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines that transform raw NYC taxi fare data into optimal temporal sequences for deep learning models. Advanced feature engineering techniques extract meaningful temporal patterns, seasonal variations, and contextual features that enhance model discrimination capabilities. The system employs rolling window analysis with adaptive threshold calculation based on recent reconstruction error distributions, enabling continuous adaptation to evolving data patterns without manual intervention.

Extensive experimental evaluation using 365+ days of authentic NYC taxi fare data (January 2024 - January 2025) demonstrates superior performance metrics including LSTM autoencoder achieving F1-score of 0.93, precision of 0.89, recall of 0.98, and accuracy of 0.91 on held-out test data. The GRU autoencoder variant shows competitive performance with F1-score of 0.88, precision of 0.85, and recall of 0.92, providing valuable redundancy for production deployments.

Real-time performance benchmarks reveal sub-second processing latency averaging 0.34 seconds per data point with 99.2% system uptime over continuous 30-day operation periods. Memory utilization remains stable at approximately 2.3 GB RAM under peak loads, demonstrating excellent resource efficiency for enterprise-scale deployments. Comparative analysis against traditional methods including Isolation Forest and statistical baselines shows 23% improvement in detection accuracy while reducing false positive rates by 31%.

The system architecture incorporates modular design principles with separate components for data ingestion, preprocessing, model inference, decision logic, and user interface. Cloud-native deployment on Streamlit Cloud platform ensures scalability, reliability, and accessibility while maintaining strict security protocols. Comprehensive monitoring dashboards provide real-time visualization of detection performance, reconstruction error analysis, and system health metrics.

Key innovations include implementation of production-correct temporal logic that prevents single-point false positives through window-level confirmation and temporal smoothing, development of efficient sequence-to-point anomaly propagation mechanisms, and creation of adaptive thresholding algorithms that maintain consistent performance across varying data distributions. The system successfully distinguishes between genuine anomalies representing fraud or system errors versus legitimate business variations caused by seasonal effects, special events, or market dynamics.

User acceptance testing with domain experts and system operators yielded 89% satisfaction ratings for interface usability, alert accuracy, and operational effectiveness. The system's interpretability features enable trust in automated decisions while providing actionable insights for investigation and response activities.

This research contributes significantly to the field of real-time anomaly detection by demonstrating the practical viability of deep learning approaches for production applications, establishing new benchmarks for performance metrics, and providing a scalable framework that can be adapted to various domains including finance, cybersecurity, industrial monitoring, and healthcare analytics.
